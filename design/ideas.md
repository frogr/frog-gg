#MORE COOL STUFF
  - referral system
  - recording trends (you're always super passive, you always play too passively into this matchup or whatever, this intertwines with the below)
  - very specific matchup analytics (you always win when you play xayah with mf support, but never with zyra, or never against xerath, sorts of insights)
  - bringing back a pseudo-version of the old "featured games" system, taking random d1-master-challenger games and
    allowing people to see what players are in a game and letting them spectate it
  - MVP system, showing maybe the best KDA on the team that wins (or look into better ways of showing who carries)
  - In match histories / stats pages, consider putting AVG CS / MIN instead of AVG CS / GAME because the former creates an actual important stat for people to keep track of whereas the latter is skewed due to game lengths and etc.
  - Average game length could be very fun as well, or maybe average win time vs average lose time per champion

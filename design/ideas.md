#MORE COOL STUFF
  - referral system
  - recording trends (you're always super passive, you always play too passively into this matchup or whatever, this intertwines with the below)
  - very specific matchup analytics (you always win when you play xayah with mf support, but never with zyra, or never against xerath, sorts of insights)
  - bringing back a pseudo-version of the old "featured games" system, taking random d1-master-challenger games and allowing people to see what players are in a game and letting them spectate it
  - MVP system, showing maybe the best KDA on the team that wins (or look into better ways of showing who carries)
